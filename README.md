Application of big data
Human fingerprints are unique, and almost no human fingerprints are exactly the same. Therefore, fingerprints are usually used as a human identification feature. Furthermore, we often call the features that can be used to uniquely identify things as fingerprint features. As an attempt to study fingerprints, we decided to study the classification of fingerprints.
